  <h2>Michigan Wolverines Football History</h2>


  <div>
    
    <p>
      The Michigan Wolverines football program, established in 1879, is the winningest program in college football history. 
      With over 950 wins and counting, the team has long been a powerhouse in the NCAA and a cornerstone of the Big Ten Conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michigan's iconic stadium, "The Big House," is the largest stadium in the United States and regularly hosts crowds exceeding 100,000 fans. 
      The electric atmosphere, traditional "Go Blue" chants, and the band's performance of "The Victors" create an unmatched game-day experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Fielding H. Yost, the Wolverines saw unprecedented early dominance, including his famed "Point-a-Minute" teams, which outscored opponents by massive margins. 
      Yost led the team to six national championships and brought respect and notoriety to Michigan football.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legendary coach Bo Schembechler took over in 1969 and introduced a new era of tough, smash-mouth football. 
      His teams won 13 Big Ten titles, and his intense rivalry with Ohio State’s Woody Hayes fueled one of the most passionate rivalries in sports — "The Game."
    </p>
    <p>
      Michigan has produced 3 Heisman Trophy winners: Tom Harmon (1940), Desmond Howard (1991), and Charles Woodson (1997), the only primarily defensive player to ever win the award.
      Howard's iconic Heisman pose and Woodson's incredible 1997 season remain defining moments in program history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wolverines are tied for the most Big Ten championships and consistently produce NFL talent, including Tom Brady, who went on to become the most decorated quarterback in NFL history.
      Other standout alumni include Jake Long, Chad Henne, Aidan Hutchinson, and Jabrill Peppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Game" between Michigan and Ohio State is considered one of the most historic rivalries in college football. 
      First played in 1897, this annual showdown often determines the Big Ten champion and features intense fanfare, national viewership, and playoff implications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, under head coach Jim Harbaugh, Michigan has regained its footing as a national contender, winning Big Ten titles in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and earning consecutive College Football Playoff appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wolverines also hold long-standing rivalries with Michigan State (Paul Bunyan Trophy) and Notre Dame, each rich with tradition and emotion.
      Their dominance over in-state rival MSU has cemented them as the premier football power in Michigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michigan's fight song, "The Victors," composed in 1898, is widely regarded as the greatest college fight song ever written. 
      The lyrics — “Hail! to the victors valiant, Hail! to the conqu'ring heroes” — are instantly recognizable to fans across the country.

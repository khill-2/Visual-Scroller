        This Web Gazer Chrome Extension offers a powerful and accessible solution for individuals with physical 
        disabilities, enabling them to interact with web content using only their eyes. By leveraging HTML, JavaScript, 
        and WebGazer.js, we were able to create an intuitive, hands-free browsing experience that not only serves the 
        disabled community but also enhances web interactions for the general public. The project demonstrates the 
        potential of eye-tracking technology in breaking down barriers to digital accessibility and offers a glimpse 
        into the future of more inclusive web experiences. Through careful design and thoughtful consideration of 
        user needs, we have developed a tool that empowers users and enhances their ability to engage with digital 
        content in a meaningful way.
